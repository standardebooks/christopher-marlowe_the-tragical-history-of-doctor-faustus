							<span>When Faustus had with pleasure ta’en the view</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Of rarest things, and royal courts of kings,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>He stayed his course, and so returned home;</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Where such as bear his absence but with grief,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>I mean his friends, and near’st companions,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Did gratulate his safety with kind words,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>And in their conference of what befell,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Touching his journey through the world and air,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>They put forth questions of Astrology,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Which Faustus answered with such learned skill</span>
							<br/>
							<span>As they admired and wondered at his wit.</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Now is his fame spread forth in every land;</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Amongst the rest the Emperor is one,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Carolus the Fifth, at whose palace now</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Faustus is feasted ’mongst his noblemen.</span>
							<br/>
							<span>What there he did in trial of his art,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>I leave untold⁠—your eyes shall see performed.</span>
