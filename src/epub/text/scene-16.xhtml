								<span>Ah, Faustus,</span>

								<span>Now hast thou but one bare hour to live,</span>

								<br/>
								<span>Stand still, you ever-moving spheres of Heaven,</span>

								<span>That time may cease, and midnight never come;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Fair Nature’s eye, rise, rise again and make</span>

								<span>The stars move still, time runs, the clock will strike,</span>

								<span>The Devil will come, and Faustus must be damned.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>O, I’ll leap up to my God! Who pulls me down?</span>

								<span>See, see where Christ’s blood streams in the firmament!</span>

								<span>One drop would save my soul⁠—half a drop: ah, my Christ!</span>
