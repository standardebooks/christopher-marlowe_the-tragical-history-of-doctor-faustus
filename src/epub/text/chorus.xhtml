							<span>Not marching now in fields of Thrasymene,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Where Mars did mate<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1" id="noteref-1" epub:type="noteref">1</a> the Carthaginians;</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Nor sporting in the dalliance of love,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>In courts of kings where state is overturned;</span>

							<span>Nor in the pomp of proud audacious deeds,</span>

							<span>Intends our Muse to vaunt her heavenly verse:</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Only this, gentlemen⁠—we must perform</span>
							<br/>
							<span>The form of Faustus’ fortunes, good or bad:</span>
							<br/>
							<span>To patient judgments we appeal our plaud,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>And speak for Faustus in his infancy.</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Now is he born, his parents base of stock,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>In Germany, within a town called Rhodes;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2" id="noteref-2" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
							<br/>
							<span>Of riper years to Wertenberg he went,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Whereas his kinsmen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3" id="noteref-3" epub:type="noteref">3</a> chiefly brought him up.</span>
							<br/>
							<span>So soon he profits in divinity,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>The fruitful plot of scholarism graced,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>That shortly he was graced with doctor’s name,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Excelling all whose sweet delight disputes</span>
							<br/>
							<span>In heavenly matters of theology;</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Till swollen with cunning<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4" id="noteref-4" epub:type="noteref">4</a> of a self-conceit,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>His waxen wings did mount above his reach,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>And, melting, heavens conspired his overthrow;</span>
							<br/>
							<span>For, falling to a devilish exercise,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>And glutted now with learning’s golden gifts,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>He surfeits upon cursed necromancy;</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Nothing so sweet as magic is to him,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Which he prefers before his chiefest bliss.</span>
							<br/>
							<span>And this the man that in his study sits!</span>
