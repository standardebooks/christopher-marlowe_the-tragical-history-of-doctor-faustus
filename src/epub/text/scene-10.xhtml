								<span>Then, Doctor Faustus, mark what I shall say.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As I was sometime solitary set</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Within my closet, sundry thoughts arose</span>
								<br/>
								<span>About the honour of mine ancestors,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>How they had won by prowess such exploits,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Got such riches, subdued so many kingdoms</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As we that do succeed, or they that shall</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Hereafter possess our throne, shall</span>
								<br/>
								<span>(I fear me) ne’er attain to that degree</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of high renown and great authority:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Amongst which kings is Alexander the Great,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Chief spectacle of the world’s preeminence,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The bright shining of whose glorious acts</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Lightens the world with his reflecting beams,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As when I hear but motion made of him</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It grieves my soul I never saw the man.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>If therefore thou by cunning of thine art,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Canst raise this man from hollow vaults below,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Where lies entombed this famous conqueror,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And bring with him his beauteous paramour,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Both in their right shapes, gesture, and attire</span>
								<br/>
								<span>They used to wear during their time of life,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thou shalt both satisfy my just desire,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And give me cause to praise thee whilst I live.</span>
