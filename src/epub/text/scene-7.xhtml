							<br/>
							<span>Environed round with airy mountain-tops,</span>

							<br/>
							<span>Not to be won by any conquering prince;</span>

							<span>The streets straight forth, and paved with finest brick,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Quarter the town in four equivalents:</span>

							<span>There saw we learned Maro’s golden tomb,</span>

							<span>The way he cut, an English mile in length,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Thorough a rock of stone, in one night’s space;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-47" id="noteref-47" epub:type="noteref">47</a></span>
